This repository demonstrates an uncommon edge case leading to a ZeroDivisionError in Python. The error arises when attempting division by zero, but the zero check is placed within a conditional statement.

The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.
